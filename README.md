# Simple String Encryption and Decryption
 This project is a Python script that provides a basic implementation of string encryption and decryption. It allows users to input a message and either encrypt or decrypt it using a simple character-shifting technique. The project includes functions to handle the encryption and decryption processes and a user interface for interaction.
